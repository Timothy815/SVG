It’s nice and easy to have CSS control all of the sizing and keep it in one place, but I sometimes leave the width and height in if I’m worried about the CSS not loading properly. If there’s no fallback for the width and height inline, the SVG will scale to the available space, which can look pretty ostentatious. For that reason, you may consider writing these values inline as well. The CSS will override the presentational attributes (but not inline styles).
